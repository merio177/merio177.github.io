                <br>Ok, it’s not that mad, but it’s pretty cool. 
                It combines the power of the OpenCV and MediaPipe libraries for Python and the Jitter toolkit in Max. 
                I’d say it’s more of an interfacing exercise than a  full-blown project, 
                as its main objective is to explore the potential of combining these tools 
                to create interactive experiences. The main goal was to bind the body 
                with the digital object in an intuitive way, and make the interaction as smooth as possible.</p>

                <p>
                <br>
                This is not a not a finished project by any means. 
                I consider it a draft for something I’d still like to develop. 
                It’s a 2D puzzle-based platformer where we play as Goggles (character name subject to change), 
                who finds himself lost in a strange world. He must navigate it and bypass 
                its obstacles to find his way back home. The gameplay loop is, as we see in the demo, 
                fairly straight forward. Enter the scene, assess the obstacles, find the solution, 
                with each scenario getting increasingly difficulty.

                <br>
                King and pawn vs king isn’t always a winning endgame. 
                The pawn must run to the end of the board and the king must 
                make sure the way is clear by keeping the opposing king at bay. 
                If this is accomplished, the pawn gets a promotion, into a queen. 
                The opponent stands no chance now. This animation tries to bring 
                to life this simple endgame concept in a fun way by adding some 
                character to the pieces. It sure is nice to win but you also can’t 
                help but feel a little empathy for the opposing king.

                <p><br>Around 17.91 parsec from the Sun lies Delta Leonis, also known as Zosma. With the stellar classification A4, it has 2.2 times the mass of our Sun and its surface burns at roughly 8296 Kelvin. It is a younger star than the Sun, at least 0.6 billion (that's nine zeros) years old, however, due to its mass, it also won’t live as long.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="about-data">
                <p><br>Its stellar system is home to the Zosmites. They’re a fun bunch, and even though they can only perceive the world through what we call sound, they can appreciate its beauty all the same. They have heard what we do with it from across the cosmos, and they appreciate it. So much so, that they wish to partake. </p>

                <span>First Ritual</span>
                <p><br>Together, we have come up with these helmets as our form of communication. When the lights turn on, it means connection is established and they take control. I followed their instructions thoroughly and conducted a small experiment with some other people. Musically, the result was rather underwhelming. But hey, let’s give them a break. After all, this was their first attempt at handling our earthly instruments and the point was to get them a bit more familiarised. Visually, though, stunning. In the end, what we really wanted to achieve is an enjoyable experience, and I believe we all had fun in sharing this first sonic ritual here on Earth.</p>

                <p><br>But this was only the beginning. The Zosmites are resourceful, fast learners, and they quickly came up with some tracks. The quite experimental single Accelerated Heat was quickly followed by the Delta Leonis demo, which has been on top of the charts since its release - the Zosma system charts, of course - and I even had the absolute pleasure of receiving an exclusive physical copy.</p>
